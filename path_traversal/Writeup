we can openly navigate threw the servers directories thanks to the variable ?page=

it is probably used like this in php

x = $_GET['page']
redirerct(x)

where the function redirect looks for a page on the webserver or more like search for a file on the webserver
it is supposed to be a file like page=page_n.php for example

but it would theorically also work for page=../lol.jpeg


or in our case to get the flag : ../../../../../../../etc/passwd
