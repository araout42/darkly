for xss we need to find a form with a parameter that is reflected on the page and is unchecked for tag injections

so if we inject javascript on the page it will be executed on the client borwser

to get the flag i just had to visit the page 

http://192.168.0.5/index.php?page=feedback

and just leave a comment with 'script' as the name


it is a stored xss because it stays on the server and every client that will visits the page will execute the code
