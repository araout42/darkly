When we visit the homepage we see at the end links to facbook twitter instgram

by looking at the link we see it is http://192.168.0.5/index.php?page=redirect&site=twitter

we can change it to
http://192.168.0.5/index.php?page=redirect&site=evil.com

so it allow an attacker to craft an url with a Official website link that will redirect
a victim on the attacker's location and might lead to phising for example
